## Development Setup

Since Inferable is a polyglot repository containing multiple programming languages, you'll need to set up the appropriate development environment for the specific component you're working on. Please refer to the README in each specific directory for detailed setup instructions.

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of significant changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation for any changed functionality
3. Ensure your code passes all tests and linting requirements
4. Add your changes to the CHANGELOG.md under the "Unreleased" section
5. The PR must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer
6. If you modify multiple languages/components, seek review from respective component owners
