## What is Inferable?

Inferable is a platform for building production-ready AI Agents. At a high level, it allows you to:

- Register **Tools** from your new or existing distributed systems.
- Define **Agents** that can use these tools to perform multi-step reasoning and take actions.
- Create **Durable Workflows** that compose agent intractions with "workflow as code".

## üëâ High-level Features

### üß∞ Tools
- Wrap your existing code as [tools](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tools), and let agents trigger them with our SDKs.
- Tools run on your [own infrastructure](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/enterprise#on-premise-tool-execution-and-data-localization), Inferable takes care of the orchestration.
- Built-in [retry, caching](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tool-configuration), and [failover](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tool-failures) support for tools.

### ü§ñ Agents
- [Multi-step reasoning agents](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/agents) who can iteratively design their own execution plan.
- Context-aware [tool selection](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/agent-tools) and built-in Service Discovery for tools.
- [Composable agents](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/multiple-agents) with structured outputs.

### üìú Workflows
- Define "[workflow as code](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/workflows)" to orchestrate agents and tools.
- Mix agent reasoning with deterministic code execution to build [complex workflows](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/multiple-agents).
- All workflows are [durable](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/workflow-durability), and run on your own infrastructure.

**...with minimal adoption curve**
- [No network ingress](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/enterprise#private-networking) needed. Everything works via long-polling HTTP endpoints.
- [Trigger workflows](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/your-first-workflow#triggering-workflows) from external events, or from other workflows. It's just HTTP.
- Fully [open-source](https://github.com/inferablehq/inferable) and self-hostable.
