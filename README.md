# The Problem

Building reliable AI agents at scale is hard.

- üíΩ **State management**: Unless we run everything in one process and in-memory, we need to manage distributed state.

- ‚õîÔ∏è **Fault tolerance**: Distributed tools mean we need to manage network failures, and coordinate between agents and tools running on different machines.

- üßë‚Äçüíª **Human in the loop**: We don't want AI to be completely autonomous. We want to build abstractions that help humans intervene.

- üîÑ **Point-in-time consistency**: Even if we've got all of this working, distributed systems are inherently unreliable. And so are the agents running on them.

# The Solution

- ü§ñ **[Managed Agent Runtime](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/runs)**: Managed [ReAct](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/react)-like agent runtime powered by your own functions.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **[Durable Tool Calling](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/functions)**: Durable execution engine helps agents recover from tool-calling failures, load balance across your compute, and caches results for fast re-runs.

- üõ°Ô∏è **[Zero Network Config](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/no-incoming-connections)**: No inbound connections or networking config required. Everything works via long-polling pub-sub.

- üîå **Multiple Language Support**: Native SDKs for TypeScript, Go, .NET and more coming soon - integrate with your existing codebase in minutes.

- ‚ú® **Fully open-source and self-hostable**: Inferable is 100% open-source, MIT licensed, and self-hostable. We also offer a managed service with high availability and a generous free tier.
