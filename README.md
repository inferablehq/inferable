## What is Inferable?

Inferable is a platform for building production-ready AI Agents. At a high level, it allows you to:

- Register **Tools** from your new or existing distributed systems.
- Define **Agents** that can use these tools to perform multi-step reasoning and take actions.
- Create **Durable Workflows** that compose agent intractions with "workflow as code".

## üëâ High-level Features

### üß∞ Tools
- Wrap your existing code as [tools](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tools), and let agents trigger them with our SDKs.
- Tools run on your [own infrastructure](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/enterprise#on-premise-tool-execution-and-data-localization), Inferable takes care of the orchestration.
- Built-in [retry, caching](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tool-configuration), and [failover](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tool-failures) support for tools.

### ü§ñ Agents
- [Multi-step reasoning agents](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/agents) who can iteratively design their own execution plan.
- Context-aware [tool selection](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/agent-tools) and built-in Service Discovery for tools.
- [Composable agents](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/multiple-agents) with structured outputs.

### üìú Workflows
- Define "[workflow as code](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/workflows)" to orchestrate agents and tools.
- Mix agent reasoning with deterministic code execution to build [complex workflows](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/multiple-agents).
- All workflows are [durable](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/workflow-durability), and run on your own infrastructure.

**...with minimal adoption curve**
- [No network ingress](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/enterprise#private-networking) needed. Everything works via long-polling HTTP endpoints.
- [Trigger workflows](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/your-first-workflow#triggering-workflows) from external events, or from other workflows. It's just HTTP.
- Fully [open-source](https://github.com/inferablehq/inferable) and self-hostable.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

### Initialize Client

```typescript
import { Inferable } from "inferable";

const inferable = new Inferable({
  // Get yours at https://app.inferable.ai
  apiSecret: ""
  // Optional, if self-hosting (https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/self-hosting)
  // baseUrl: "http://localhost:4000",
});
```

### Register a Tool

Register a [tool](https://docs.inferable.ai/pages/tools) which is available for your agents to use.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This example demonstrates Node.js. Tools can also be written in Go or .NET.

```typescript
inferable.tools.register({
  name: "greet",
  func: async (input) => {
    return `Hello, ${input.name}! My name is ${os.hostname()}.`;
  },
  schema: {
    input: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
    }),
  },
});

inferable.tools.listen();
```

### Create a Workflow

Workflows are a way to orchestrate agents. They are durable, distributed, and run on the machine that they are registered on.


> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Workflow definitions can currently only be written in Node.js.

```typescript
const workflow = inferable.workflows.create({
  name: "greeting",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    executionId: z.string(),
    userName: z.string(),
  }),
});

workflow.version(1).define(async (ctx, input) => {
  const greetingAgent = ctx.agent({
    name: "greeter",
    tools: ["greet"],
    systemPrompt: helpers.structuredPrompt({
      facts: ["You are a friendly greeter"],
      goals: ["Return a greeting to the user"]
    }),
    resultSchema: z.object({
      greeting: z.string(),
    }),
  });

  const result = await greetingAgent.trigger({
    data: {
      name: input.userName,
    }
  });

  console.log(result.result.greeting);
});

workflow.listen();
```

### Trigger the Workflow

Tgger the workflow from your application code or via a HTTP request.

```typescript
await inferable.workflows.trigger('greeting', {
  executionId: `123`,
  userName: "Alice",
});
```

```bash
curl -XPOST https://api.inferable.ai/clusters/$CLUSTER_ID/workflows/greeting/executions \
  -d '{"executionId": "123", "userName": "Alice"}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_SECRET"
```
