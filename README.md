## What is Inferable?

Inferable is a platform for building production-ready AI Agents. At a high level, it allows you to:

- Register **Tools** from your existing distributed systems.
- Define **Agents** that can use these tools to perform multi-step reasoning.
- Create **Durable Workflows** to combine agent reasoning with deterministic code execution.

## Features

### Tools
- Wrap your existing code as tools, and let agents trigger them.
- Tools run on your own infrastructure, Inferable takes care of the orchestration.
- Built-in retry, caching, and failover support for tools.

### Agents
- Multi-step agents who can iteratively design their own execution plan.
- Context-aware tool selection based on Tool Discovery.
- Composable agents with structured outputs.

### Workflows
- Define "workflow as code" to orchestrate agents and tools.
- Mix agent reasoning with deterministic code execution to build complex workflows.
- All workflows are durable, and run on your own infrastructure.
