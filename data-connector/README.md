# Inferable Data Connector

Inferable Data Connector is a bridge between your data systems and Inferable. Configure your data sources in a json file and start conversing with your data in natural language.

Works locally, and in any dockerized environment with zero network access required.

## Features

- üîê **Secure Credential Management**: Your credentials are never exfiltrated outside of the dockerized environment.
- üåê **No incoming network access required**: The connector runs inside your network, or in your local machine, and communicates with Inferable via long-polling.
- üß© **Extensible**: Adding a new data source is as simple as writing a new connector. See the [Postgres](./src/postgres.ts) connector for an example.
- üîÑ **Adapts to schema changes**: The connector automatically adapts to schema changes by periodically fetching the data system schema. (Table definitions, API definitions, etc.)
- ü§ø **Optional Privacy Mode**: Query outputs are never sent to the model. Instead, the function returns results directly to the end user without any model involvement.
- üîç **Optional Paranoid Mode**: Adds an additional safety layer by requiring manual approval before executing any query so you can review the query and data before it is executed.

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set your Inferable API secret:

```bash
INFERABLE_SECRET=your_secret_here

# DEMO POSTGRES CONFIG
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres
POSTGRES_SCHEMA=public
```

3. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:

- Start a PostgreSQL database with sample data
- Launch the Inferable connector service
- Provide you with a direct link to the Inferable playground where you can start querying

## Sample Data

The demo database comes pre-loaded with sample data (defined in `example_data/seed.ts`). You can use this to experiment with queries and understand how the connector works.

## Configuration

The connector is configured using the `config.json` file.

### config.connectors

Each connector is defined in the `config.connectors` array.

- `type`: The type of connector. Currently only `postgres` is supported.
- `name`: The name of the connector. This is the Inferable service name. One will be generated if not provided.

### Connector-specific configuration

| Connector | Configuration                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Postgres  | `connectionString` and `schema` |

### config.privacyMode

When enabled (`config.privacyMode=1`), raw data is never sent to the model. Instead:

- The model generates SQL queries based on schema information
- Queries are executed locally
- Only results are returned

Note: This may limit some advanced reasoning capabilities that require direct data access.

### config.paranoidMode

Adds an additional safety layer by requiring manual approval before executing any queries. Enable with `config.paranoidMode=1`. This can get annoying really quickly, so we've disabled it by default.

## Production Deployment

When deploying to production, follow these security best practices:

1. **Read-Only Access**: Use a read-only database connection string to prevent any possibility of data mutations.

2. **Privacy Considerations**:

   - Enable `config.privacyMode=1` if your data security requirements prohibit sharing raw data
   - The model will still receive metadata (schema, table names, data types)

3. **Query Approval**:
   - Set `config.paranoidMode=1` to require manual approval of queries
   - This provides an additional layer of control over database interactions

## Architecture

- All queries execute within the dockerized environment
- Neither the model nor the Inferable Control Plane can execute queries directly
- Database schema information is used to guide query generation

## FAQ

**Q: Can this hallucinate?**  
A: Any result generated by an LLM is prone to hallucination. However, we provide two means to mitigate this:

- **Privacy Mode**: Raw data is never sent to the model. Instead, the model generates SQL queries based on schema information.
- **Function results**: Any data received by the model is also visible in the function results in Playground. You can directly verify if the model's output is correct.

**Q: Can the model see my data?**  
A: By default, yes, but enabling `config.privacyMode` ensures that only database metadata (schema, table names, data types) is shared with the model.

**Q: Where do the queries execute?**  
A: All queries execute within your dockerized environment. Neither the model nor the Inferable Control Plane have direct query execution capabilities.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To add support for a new database:

1. Create a new connector file in `src/<connector>.ts`
2. Implement the necessary connection and query interfaces
3. Submit a pull request

We're actively working on adding more data connectors to support various database systems.
